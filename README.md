# VR Game Streaming Application

This repository contains the code for a VR game streaming application that allows users to play a computer game and view it on an Android phone using a VR headset. This project is developed as part of the CSE 396 Computer Engineering Project at Gebze Technical University in Spring 2024.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to enhance the gaming experience by leveraging VR technology. The application streams the game's video to an Android phone, enabling users to enjoy an immersive VR experience.

## Functionality

The application performs the following tasks:
- Streams video from the game running on a computer to an Android phone.
- Uses the phone's gyroscope to send rotation data back to the game for real-time interaction.
- Supports custom controllers for sending movement data to the game.
